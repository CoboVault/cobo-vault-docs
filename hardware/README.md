# Cobo Vault Hardware
Our product design philosophy is to minimize trust dependencies. A crucial way of minimizing trust is to make our product as transparent as possible.

As part of working towards this goal, we are open sourcing the hardware design of Cobo Vault Essential and Pro. We encourage researchers to use it to rebuild our product for further verification.

## Schematic
`Cobo_Vault_V1.02_schematic.pdf`

Notes:
The self-destruct mechanism has been removed from the schematic as we chose not to disclose all of its functionality.
In order to minimize the attack surface, we do not share detailed information on the Secure Element. For researchers who are interested in our Secure Element design, you can request we share the development board, datasheet, and other materials under NDA (required by our Secure Element vendor). Contact us at cobovault@cobo.com.
