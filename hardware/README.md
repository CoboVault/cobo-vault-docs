# Cobo Vault Hardware
One of product design principles is minimizing trust. A crucial way of minimizing trust is making our product as transparent as possible.

To get to that goal, now we open source the hardware design of the Cob Vault Pro/Essential. Researchers can rebuild our product from it for further verification.

Notes:
Self-destruct mechanism has been removed for better protection.
We canâ€™t share detailed information about the Secure Element to minimize attack surface. For those who are interested in our Secure Element, we can share development board/datasheet/other material under an NDA(this is required by our Secure Element vendor)
