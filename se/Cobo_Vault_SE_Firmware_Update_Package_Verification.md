# Cobo Vault Secure Element Firmware Upgrade Package Verification

## Introduction
Cobo Vault offers a method for verifying official release upgrade packages. You can compare a version package you compiled from Github source code with the official release update package to accomplish this.

The python script [make_update_package.py](https://github.com/CoboVault/cobo-vault-se-firmware/tree/master/upgrade/make_update_package.py) is for verifying secure element firmware update package.

Refer to the below sections for instructions.

## Download official release update package
- [Firmware upgrades on the official Cobo Vault website](https://cobo.com/hardware-wallet/firmware)

## Unzip official release update package
Use [update public key](https://github.com/CoboVault/cobo-vault-cold/blob/master/app/build.gradle#L112) to unzip upgrade package.
An upgrade package consists of the following parts:
- `app_[version_code]_[version_name]_[git_commit_id]_[apk_sha1_checksum].apk` : Cobo Vault cold upgrade version package
- `manifest.json` : Upgrade package digest information
- `serial_*.bin` : Cobo Vault Secure Element upgrade version package
- `signed.rsa` : Signature for upgrade package

## Download source code
Download the code of the branch corresponding to the official upgrade package version from Github. For example, if the official upgrade package version is `V0.3.6`, the corresponding code branch is `V0.3.6-release`.
Run the following command to download the code:

`git clone -b [code branch] git@github.com:CoboVault/cobo-vault-se-firmware.git`

Replace `[code branch]` with a specific branch name.

## Build secure element firmware
Build with ARM IDEs like "Keil MDK V4.x".   
1. Download Keil MDK4.x [here](https://www.keil.com/demo/eval/armv4.htm).
2. Install MDK and register license.
3. Run MDK, and add firmware project. Open the dialog `Project - Open Project`, select `mason.uvproj` in directory `cobo-vault-se-firmware/`.
4. Build the firmware project. Select the dialog `Project - Rebuild all target files` to compile the source files.
5. Find the firmware image `mason_app.hex` and `mason_app.bin` in directory `cobo-vault-se-firmware/`.

## Make upgrade package
  Use python script `make_update_package.py` in directory `cobo-vault-se-firmware/upgrade/` to make a upgrade package from build hex file.
  Command is `make_update_package.py -t TARGET_VERSION`, `TARGET_VERSION` should be same as official release update package. You can find it in `cobo-vault-se-firmware/source/version_def.h`.
  Such as `Python upgrade/make_update_package.py -t 0.3.6.000000`. `app.0.3.6.000000.bin` is the update package.

  `app.0.3.6.000000.bin` is consist of the following parts:
| Index | Part | Length | Description
|:-------:|:-----------------:|:-----------------:|:-----------------
1 | Header | 128Bytes   | version info and signature for verifying
2 | Body   | 528Bytes*n | version package encrypted and checksum

Update Package Header's length is 128 bytes. It is consist of the following parts:
| Index | Item | Length | Description
|:-------:|:-----------------:|:-----------------:|:-----------------
1 | ver            | 4Bytes     | version BCD encode
2 | ver_checksum   | 4Bytes     | front 4 bytes of ver sha256
3 | reserve        | 24Bytes    | reserve
4 | body_hash      | 32Bytes    | sha256 value of entire body
5 | signature      | 64Bytes    | signature of body_hash

Update Package Body has several 528 bytes blocks. Each block is consist of the following parts:
| Index | Item |  Sub Item| Length | Description
|:-------:|:-----------------:|:-----------------:|:-----------------:|:-----------------
1 | block_content  |  block_addr   | 8Bytes   | flash address of block (3des encrypt)
2 | block_content  |  block_bin    | 512Bytes | package bin of block (3des encrypt)
2 | bloc_checksum  |  /            | 8Bytes   | front 8 bytes of block_content(3des encrypt) sha256

More information about "make_update_package.py" , you can execute `make_update_package.py -h`

## Verify update package
After compare the update package with the `serial_*.bin` unzipped from official release update package,
You will find the "signature" in update Package Header is different.

Beyond that, the other parts should be same.
It could prove the official release update package was built by Github source code.
