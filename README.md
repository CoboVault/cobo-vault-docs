# Cobo Vault Developer Documents

Cobo Vault is an air-gapped, open source hardware wallet that uses completely transparent QR code data transmissions. Visit the Cobo Vault official [website](https://cobo.com/hardware-wallet/cobo-vault) to learn more.

## High Level Architecture
Cobo Vault is built on a specialized security hardware platform with a Secure Element that currently runs on a highly secure and enhanced Android Go platform.

The userâ€™s master seed is saved in the Secure Element and never leaves it. The Secure Element communicates with the hardware wallet application layer through a serial communication protocol. Users need to set a password before using Cobo Vault, which can be used to unlock the device, sign transactions, or do other sensitive operations.

We use QR code data transmissions to air-gap. For details on the data protocol we use, please check [here](https://github.com/CoboVault/crypto-coin-message-protocol)

QR codes are limited in how data they can contain, so we use animated QR codes to handle larger transmissions of data. Here is an sample:

```
{
    "total": 2,
    "index": 1,
    "checkSum": "807271c36d6e275b0e89b023ccf8e3b6",
    "value": "H4sIAAAAAAAAAyVPu0oDURQ0UZYllWy51RKESGDdc88995VCJCaLjaIYbeW+tgoshAj+gxZ+gP6Dlb9h5f94F4eBmWaGmXxclJe966tH+7zdV3e7yz7E6nbX73vfb8uPcT4uLkghC+gUi2iRGx6EDjqQ4x2TTnsK1kt0gBC0AgHEQURhrTLo0QkTp7+jyeF6c1WcOB+pSx21IIM1yWhqG5mpSShuu4jSMCyPrxuiWSNh1gxssPr6/vl8PTstFm+jyRxe1sSApQQJF4WUWrfE2xZWJtISl1yvrW6VRl1kDAaUk38dMM0YlxpgfgDZ4jzPiqOH+9WmzNO8p8FNU3/6w1Rn0kuMUSC3iCATjSFhlGc8aM6iV9X7zR9wPHYkQAEAAA==",
    "compress": true,
    "valueType": "protobuf"
}
```

The `total` field is for the total number of animated QR codes and the `index` field is for the index number of the QR codes. The `value` field is for the chunk of data. The `compress` field is an indicator of whether the data is compressed (currently we use gzip + base64 to compress data). The `checkSum` field is the checksum of the whole data.

we are working an demo of the animated QRCodes. once finished we will open it on our Github.
